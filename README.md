# LP-Sudoku-Variants

This repository is dedicated to a linear programming solution of multiple sudoku variants using Pythons PULP library.


## Sudoku
This section contains a brief introduction and python code to solve a basic sudoku with linear programming.

## Killer Sudoku
This section contains a detailed linear programming model and python code to solve a killer sudoku with linear programming.
In killer sudoku, the board contains multiple sections. Each section is made of 2 or more adjacent cells where all values in those cells have to add, subtract, multiply or divide to a given result.
In case of subtraction or division, a section will always contain exactly 2 cells.
